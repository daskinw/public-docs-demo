<summary>Social preview</summary>

Here, you can upload a custom social preview image for your site. This will set the site’s `og:image` to your uploaded image, and it’ll show when the site’s link is shared to any platform or product that supports OpenGraph images, such as Slack or X.

If you don’t add a social preview, GitBook will automatically generate one using your theme color, page title and description.

If your site has multiple [site sections](site-structure/site-sections.md), you can use the drop-down menu in this modal to add a custom social preview image for each one, or for your entire site.
