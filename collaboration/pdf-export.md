# PDF export

### Allow readers to export a PDF version of your published content

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is available on [Premium and Ultimate site plans](https://www.gitbook.com/pricing).
{% endhint %}

To enable or disable PDF export for visitors to your [published docs site](broken-reference/), open the docs site’s dashboard and click the **Settings** tab.

You can enable PDF export by toggling it on in the **Customization** section.

This setting determines whether or not **readers of your published content can download it in PDF format**. This feature is only available for **Standard and Premium sites**.

### Export your own internal content as PDF

However you decide to configure your published docs sites, all logged-in members of an organization on a Pro or Enterprise can export a page — or an entire space — from your internal knowledge base as a PDF file.

#### Export an individual page

1.  Open the page you want to export, then open the page’s [Actions menu](../resources/gitbook-ui.md#the-actions-menu)&#x20;

    <picture><source srcset="../.gitbook/assets/actions_icon_dark.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="../.gitbook/assets/actions_icon_light.svg" alt=""></picture>

    &#x20;next to the page title.
2. Select **Export to PDF > Current page**.
3. Wait for the page to load, then click the **Print or save as PDF** button in the upper right to open your browsers Print menu.
4. From here, you can save the page as a PDF or open it in your PDF viewer using the typical process for your browser.

#### Export an entire space

1.  Open the[ Actions menu](../creating-content/content-structure/)&#x20;

    <picture><source srcset="../.gitbook/assets/actions_icon_dark.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="../.gitbook/assets/actions_icon_light.svg" alt=""></picture>

    &#x20;next to the page title and choose **Export as PDF > All pages**. Alternatively, open the **Space options**&#x20;

    <picture><source srcset="../.gitbook/assets/actions_icon_dark.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="../.gitbook/assets/actions_icon_light.svg" alt=""></picture>

    &#x20;menu on the far right of the space header and choose **Export as PDF** in the drop-down menu.
2. Wait for the page to load, then click the **Print or save as PDF** button in the upper right to open your browsers Print menu.
3. From here, you can save the page as a PDF or open it in your PDF viewer using the typical process for your browser.
