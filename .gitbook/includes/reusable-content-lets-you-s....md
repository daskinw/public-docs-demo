Reusable content lets you sync content across multiple pages in a GitBook space, so you can edit all instances of the block at the same time.

## **Create reusable content**

To create reusable content, [select one or more blocks](../../creating-content/blocks/#selecting-blocks-and-interacting-with-selected-blocks), then open the **Actions menu** <picture><source srcset="../assets/actions_icon_dark.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="../assets/actions_icon_light.svg" alt=""></picture> and choose **Turn into reusable content**. You can also give your block a name to make it easier to find and reuse later.

Alternatively, you can select one or more blocks and then hit **Cmd + C** to open a prompt asking if you want to create reusable content.
